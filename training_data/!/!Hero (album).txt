
!Hero is an album featuring the songs from the rock opera, !Hero. It is based on the question, "What if Jesus was born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania?" The rock opera modernizes Jesus' last two years on earth and features a cast of many well-known Christian rock artists with Michael Tait, Rebecca St. James, and Mark Stuart as the three main characters: Hero (Jesus), Maggie (Mary Magdalene), and Petrov (Peter).

Chris Well, writing for CCM Magazine, reviewed it favorably and stated, ""!Hero" is inventive, rhythmic and should, no doubt, spark debate everywhere about the real Jesus.
On the other hand, Andree Farias of Christian Music Today, wrote, "!Hero's attempt to be all things to all people is well-intentioned, its "replayability" value is minimal, deeming it no more than a glorified post-concert souvenir for the live stage show."
