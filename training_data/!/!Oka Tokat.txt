
!Oka Tokat is a Filipino paranormal drama which originally aired on ABS-CBN from June 24, 1997 to July 2, 2002 every Tuesday night. It starred Ricky Davao, Diether Ocampo, Jericho Rosales, Angelika Dela Cruz, Rica Peralejo, Paolo Contis and Agot Isidro. Its title is the reverse spelling of the phrase "Takot ako!" ("I'm scared!"); hence, the exclamation point at the beginning. In 2001, the series was reformatted and it starred by the several child stars. It was the longest-running horror series on Philippine television.

The show revolves around a media crew led by Rona del Fierro (played by Isidro) who investigate paranormal cases with the help del Fierro's premonitions. Most of the story arcs feature creatures in Filipino mythology, including the "dwende" (dwarf), tikbalang, diwata and the engkanto.

It was re-aired on ABS-CBN's cable channel, Jeepney TV.



In 2011, ABS CBN announced that !Oka Tokat will have its sequel entitled "Oka2kat". It was supposed to be aired on March 2011 but it had been delayed until February 4, 2012. The sequel does not focus on the previous characters but has the same genre.
